# Theoretically speaking the game should be somewhat finished theoretically speaking the only thing left that I should have to do would be to fix the endless amount of easter eggs and "hidden features" of the program that continously ruin your playing experience

The solution to this problem, should, in theoretics, be to carefully test the code and find and fix bugs, however, the actual technique we will be using is a careful custom made mix of renaming certain "bugs", straight up ignoring them, or/and hiding them with extensive use of Try/Except error catching :)

# THIS IS ALL PURELY THEORETICAL PLANNING GARBAGE!!!


# Story

You, like many others, were chosen to find and kill the enslaver

# How To Win:

Reach the darkest depths of dungeon and kill the enslaver

More Enslaved enemies meet you at the bottom making it more and more difficult to reach the enslaver


The dungeon is randomized due to the enslaver trying to prevent you from defeating him


## Notes

The Enslaved are just the normal enemies but that take less damage and deal more damage. They feel no pain, but they are dumber than other monsters. 




# In Progress

# TODO: 

* Add Enemies

* Dungeon rooms become smaller and smaller the deaper you reach

* Add resting to heal

* Food becomes more scarce the lower you get

* Remove random Weapons/Armor for Custom created ones

* Each Dungeon level get's progressivly more difficult with more and more good gear. 

* Dungeon levels quickly reach the point where you must avoid enemy to not die

* random Ghouls attack

* Give enemies buffs again

* update the food system

* Add Supports for Colors in screen.py

* Convert all Player Functions that require Display output over to screen class

* Difficulty increases the deeper you reach into the dungeon, it gets darker (lantern) and enemies get stronger and more deadly.
